#AIM OF THE PROJECT:
The  aim  of  the  project  is  to build  a  Machine  Learning Model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.

#USE CASES:

(A).Conquering Market Share:Capture market share by lowering the prices of the premium for the customers, who are least likely to claim.

(B).Risk Management:Charge the right premium from the customer, who is likely to claim insurance in the coming year 

(C).Smooth Processing:Reduce the complexity of pricing models.Most of the transactions are happening online with largercustomer attributes(thanks to the internet and social media).Harness the power of huge data to build complex ML models 

(D).Increased Profits:As per industry estimate 1% reduction in the claim can boost profit by 10%. So, through the ML model, we can identify and deny the insurance to the driver who will make a claim.  Thus, ensuring reduced claim outgo and increased profit.

#Process Flow:

(a).EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

(b)Machine Learning Modeling
